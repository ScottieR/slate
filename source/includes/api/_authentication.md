# Authentication

## Logging in a user and authenticating your client

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
	curl --data "email=[email]&password=[password]" https://travelenvy.com/api/sessions
```

```ruby
#In your ruby console:
require 'oauth2'

client_id     = '...' # your client's id
client_secret = '...' # your client's secret
redirect_uri  = '...' # your client's redirect uri
site          = "http://localhost:3000" # your provider server, this is showing localhost

client = OAuth2::Client.new(client_id, client_secret, :site => site)

client.auth_code.authorize_url(:redirect_uri => redirect_uri)
# => http://localhost:3000/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=...&redirect_uri=...

#visit the url generated by the above code while signed in to a TravelEnvy account, then get the access_code returned in the url and use as [ACCESS_CODE] in the following call
access = client.auth_code.get_token([ACCESS_CODE], redirect_uri: redirect_uri)

#OR pass a valid username & password to the oauth client retrieve the access token
access = client.password.get_token('user@example.com', 'sekret')

#Get token to append to HTTP requests by calling
puts access.token
```
